FizzBuzz method

Problem:
Write a method that takes one number as an argument. For multiples of three return “Fizz”, and for the multiples of five return “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five return “FizzBuzz”, and in all other cases return the number.

The method will return a string with the result. Start with a empty string. Concatenate 'Fizz' if appropriate. Concatenate 'Buzz' if appropriate. Set string to number if niether 'Fizz' nor 'Buzz'.
