# FizzBuzz Advanced

By Ronald Kinch.

## Description

Problem:
Write a method that takes one number as an argument. For multiples of three return “Fizz”, and for the multiples of five return “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five return “FizzBuzz”, and in all other cases return the number.

The method will return a string with the result. Start with a empty string. Concatenate 'Fizz' if appropriate. Concatenate 'Buzz' if appropriate. Set string to number if niether 'Fizz' nor 'Buzz'.

Our clients request that numbers that are multiples of seven will result in a "Sivv" (so, 105 will print "FizzBuzzSivv").

Actually, they have a long list of arbitrary other numbers they'd like this program to handle in a similar fashion. For example, some clients want multiples of 13 to display with "Grrr". They want to be able to change what/how multiples print every week.
